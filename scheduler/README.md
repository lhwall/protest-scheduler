Thank you for your interest in the Protest Scheduler!

This project is designed to allow people to schedule and announce protests, rallies, and direct actions although it could be easily modified as a scheduler for basically any type of event.

This can be modified or adapted simply by cloning the code from Github (for testing, I have run it with shotgun).  

If you wish to contribute, please make sure you provide a brief description for any methods you add.
